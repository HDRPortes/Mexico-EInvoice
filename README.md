## Installation and Configuration

### Features Supported Currently
- Generate E-Invoice
- Download E-Invoice

### Pre-Requisite
Before getting started, you need to create and set up an account for your organization on [FactureAPI](https://www.facturapi.io/).

### Configuration
To configure Mexico E Invoicing, follow these steps:
1. Set up an account on FacturAPI and obtain the Secret Key.
2. Navigate to the "E Invoice Setting" section in ERPNext.
3. Configure the FacturAPI Secret Key in the settings to establish the connection between Mexico E Invoicing and FacturAPI.

## Running Semgrep (Linters) locally

The app uses [Frappe Semgrep rules](https://github.com/frappe/semgrep-rules) for linting, as required by [Frappe Cloud Marketplace guidelines](https://docs.frappe.io/cloud/marketplace/app-authoring-guidelines#linters-and-server-tests-ci).

**One-time setup:**

```bash
# From your machine (any directory)
pip install semgrep
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/frappe/semgrep-rules.git frappe-semgrep-rules
```

**Run Semgrep from the app root** (e.g. `apps/mexico_einvoice` or your repo root):

```bash
# If you cloned frappe-semgrep-rules inside the app:
cd /path/to/mexico_einvoice
semgrep --config ./frappe-semgrep-rules/rules --config r/python.lang.correctness .
```

If the rules repo is elsewhere (e.g. `~/frappe-semgrep-rules`):

```bash
cd /path/to/mexico_einvoice
semgrep --config ~/frappe-semgrep-rules/rules --config r/python.lang.correctness .
```

- Use `--severity=ERROR` to only report errors (ignore warnings).
- Fix or exclude any reported issues so that CI (and marketplace review) passes.
